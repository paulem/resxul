Resxul is a tool to simplify compilation of `.resx` files into `satellite assemblies` for further localization testing.

Compiling a .resx file into a .net satellite assembly requires the use of `resgen.exe` and `al.exe` utilities with several parameters passed to them. Resxul uses these two utilities under the hood and allows you to create a satellite assembly in a few clicks by introducing the concept of profiles.
